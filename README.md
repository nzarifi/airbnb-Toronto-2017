# airbnb-Toronto-2017
The data collected from the public Airbnb web site is for Toronto city and is available on https://github.com/tomslee/airbnb-data-collection. I explore the guests experiences and what affects the most on their decision to rate the room. Random Forest and Logistic Regression were used to build predictive models.
